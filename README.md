# Rusty Bot

Rusty Bot is a simple chat bot built with the Rust programming language. It is designed to be easily extensible and customizable, allowing you to add your own functionality to the bot.

## Installation

To run Rusty Bot, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone the Rusty Bot repository and build the bot by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/JessevGool/rusty_bot.git
cd rusty_bot
cargo build
```

This will download the necessary dependencies and build the bot.

## Usage

To use Rusty Bot, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
cargo run
```

This will start the bot and connect it to your chat application.

By default, Rusty Bot will respond to messages that begin with `~ping` by saying "pong" in the chat. You can customize this behavior and add your own functionality to the bot by modifying the code in `src/main.rs`.
